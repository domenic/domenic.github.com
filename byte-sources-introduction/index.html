    <p><em>This post is the beginning of a series of posts regarding some of the more interesting issues I&rsquo;ve encountered while working on the Streams Standard.</em></p>

<p>In the <a href="http://streams.spec.whatwg.org/">Streams Standard</a> we have the concept of readable streams, which are an abstraction on top of the lower-level <strong>underlying sources</strong>. In an abstract sense an underlying source is &ldquo;where the chunks of data come from.&rdquo; The most basic underlying sources are things like files or HTTP connections. (More complicated ones could be e.g. an underlying source that randomly generates data in-memory for test purposes, or one that synthesizes data from multiple concrete locations.) These basic underlying sources are concerned with direct production of bytes.</p>

<p>The major goal of the Streams Standard is to provide an efficient abstraction specifically for I/O. Thus, to design a suitable readable stream abstraction, we can&rsquo;t just think about general concepts of <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/gtor/">reactivity</a> or <a href="https://github.com/zenparsing/async-iteration/">async iterables</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jhusain/asyncgenerator#introducing-observable">observables</a>. We need to dig deeper into how, exactly, the underlying sources will work. Otherwise we might find ourselves <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/streams/issues/253">scrambling</a> to reform the API at the last minute when confronted with real-world implementation challenges. (Oops.)</p>

<p>The current revision of the standard describes underlying sources as belonging to two broad categories: push sources, where data is constantly flowing in, and pull sources, where you specifically request it. The prototypal examples of these categories are TCP sockets and file descriptors. Once a TCP connection is open, the remote server will begin pushing data to you. Whereas, with a file, until you ask the OS to do a read, no I/O happens.</p>

<p>This division is conceptually helpful, but it&rsquo;s instructive to go deeper and look at the actual system APIs in play here. Given that concepts like &ldquo;events&rdquo; are way too high-level for an OS API, they end up being shaped quite differently than how you might imagine. We&rsquo;ll assume a POSIX environment for most of this series, but I&rsquo;d like to talk about some Windows specifics toward the end. Along the way we&rsquo;ll continually be trying to bridge the gap between these C APIs and how they might manifest in JavaScript, both to give the less-C-inclined readers a chance, and to illustrate the issues we&rsquo;ve been wrestling with in the Streams Standard.</p>

<p>So far these are the episodes I have planned:</p>

<ol>
<li>Byte sources: introduction (this post)</li>
<li><a href="/reading-from-files/">Reading from files</a></li>
<li><a href="/reading-from-sockets/">Reading from sockets</a></li>
<li>Byte source APIs on Windows</li>
<li>Byte source APIs in libuv and io.js</li>
<li>Readable streams</li>
</ol>

<p>I will update this post with links to them as they become available.</p>
